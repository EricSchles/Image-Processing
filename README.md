# Image-Processing
This repository will contain my snippets of python code used in mini projects related to image processing


face_recognition.py : This is a face recognition project I've worked on in the past. It detects/recognizes faces
of people on live webcam feed. There are snippets of code that demonstrate image pre-processing, training a classifier
and real-time prediction (or face recognition)

facedetect_crop.py : This code can be used to preprocess any existing images that can be used for training a classifier.
It can detects multiple faces in a picture/live webcam feed (and simultaneously save) and re-center in to the face.
